        <h2>BF-109</h2>
        <p>The Allies feared the Bf 109 for its speed, climb rate, and potent armament, including 20mm cannons. Its advanced design, adaptability at high altitudes, and skilled Luftwaffe pilots made it dominant early in WWII. Superior agility and combat performance challenged Allied air forces until later aircraft matched its capabilities.</p>

        <h2>FW-190</h2>
        <p>The Allies respected the Fw 190 for its rugged design, exceptional roll rate, heavy armament (cannons, machine guns), and radial engine reliability. Faster than most contemporaries at low-to-medium altitudes, it excelled in ground attack and air combat. Its versatility and firepower forced Allied forces to rapidly upgrade fighters to counter its dominance.</p>
